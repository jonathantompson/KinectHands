1. Fix the Hand model so that the wrist is a bone off the palm.
2. Fix the scaling of the UV coordinates
  KinectHands->app.cpp->renderCrossToImageArr
  HandFit->renderCrossToImageArr
  HandFit->HandRenderer->calcHandImageUVFromXYZ
3. Added the new data to the Decision Forest and re-train it.  It messes up
   a lot of frames and I wonder if we can do better (even just taller trees?)
