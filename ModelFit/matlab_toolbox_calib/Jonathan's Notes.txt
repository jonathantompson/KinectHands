Take images in KinectHands using the greyscale screenshot button.

Run the calibrate.m script

Press "Extract grid corners"

Press Enter to choose all default values

When prompted, click the upper left, upper right, lower right, lower left corners of the grid (in that order) and ONE checkbox from the edge (NOT the edge box).

Enter the size of each square (my squares were 44.5 x 44.5mm)

Now repeat the clicking for every image

After finishing click "Calibrate"

Then "Save"

The output results will be in the command window

Recall: FOV = 2 * arctan (film_size / (2*focal_length))
