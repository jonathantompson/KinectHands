TO DO:

- Add blur to the point fill -> Backend is there, just need Ken's blur routine.

- Fix axis consistency --> Maybe a better algorithm?

- If the two hands have overlapping points, seperate the two

- Use instruments to find slow code.

- Try Murphy's idea of checking pixels between the jump in the flood fill are
  black --> Might solve the problem of jumping between hands.
  
- Put Kinect in a seperate thread
