//  thread_pool.h
//
//  Created by Jonathan Tompson on 7/10/12.
//
//  Origionally this was a pthreads thread pool (linux only) which was written
//  for my Spring 2012 NYU class Mulitcore Programming.  I ported the pthreads
//  calls to C++11 std::thread.  
//
//  It makes use of a small optimization where, new tasks will be handed 
//  directly to idle threads if any are idle, otherwise it will be placed on the
//  queue for execution (with appropriate overhead).
