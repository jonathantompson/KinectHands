first zip into one zip file

>> zip -1 -r hand_depth_data.zip ./hand_depth_data

Then split

>> zip hand_depth_data.zip --out hand_depth_data_split.zip -s 1000m

to combine split zip files in unix (or Mac OS X from command line), use:

zip -FF split_zip_filename.zip --out zip_filename.zip

--> Don't both with "cat split_zip_filename.z* > zip_filename.zip", the zip -FF untility
will fix up the zip file for you.
