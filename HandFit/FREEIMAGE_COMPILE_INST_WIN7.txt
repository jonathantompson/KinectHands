Download the free image source distribution from:
http://freeimage.sourceforge.net/download.html (I got 3154)

- Extract it somewhere and open FreeImage/FreeImage.2008.sln in VS2012
- Perform the upgrade when asked
- Change from Debug to Release.
- Change from Win32 to x64
- Right click on Solution->Build

The output is in FreeImage\Release\FreeImage.dll & FreeImage.lib
