Windows 7 - VS 2012 - 64bit

Install a microsoft directx 9 SDK (I installed June 2010)
http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=6812
Note to install the above, I had to uninstall some redistributable packages.
This can be done from the command line using:
>> MsiExec.exe /passive /X{F0C3E5D1-1ADE-321E-8167-68EF0DE699A5}
>> MsiExec.exe /passive /X{1D8E6291-B0D5-35EC-8441-6616F567A0F7}

Download the boost libraries and extract them to c:\Boost
(Unfortunately the assimp "boost workaround build" is REALLY slow because
there is no multi-threading on any of the mesh operations)

http://www.boost.org/users/download/  (I downloaded 1.51)

- In cmd window
- >> cd c:\Boost\tools\build\v2\
- >> bootstrap.bat
- >> bjam install --prefix="c:\Boost"
- >> cd c:\Boost
- >> mkdir c:\build-boost
- >> set PATH=%PATH%;C:\Boost\bin
- >> bjam --build-dir="c:\build-boost" toolset=msvc --build-type=complete stage
- The above will take ~1-2 hours
- Results are in "C:\Boost"\lib"

Download and extract "full" from:
http://sourceforge.net/projects/assimp/files/assimp-3.0/

- Open CMake GUI.
- For "where is the source code?:" put c:/.../assimp--3.0.1270-sdk
- For build path put c:/.../assimp--3.0.1270-sdk/build
- Press configure --> Choose the latest VS with 64bits
- Click "Advanced" button
- Click on Boost_DIR and change it to C:/
- Note: We are NOT adding VC10_STDINT_FIX flag.  So don't do it!
- enable BUILD_ASSIMP_SAMPLES
- Press configure twice.
- Download Glut64 from http://www.idfun.de/glut64/
- Copy glut.h and glut.def to assimp--3.0.1270-sdk/include/GL
- Copy glut32.dll, glut32.lib, glut64.dll, glut64.lib to assimp--3.0.1270-sdk/lib
- In CMake change GLUT_INCLUDE_DIR to assimp--3.0.1270-sdk/include (by browsing)
- Choose C:/.../assimp--3.0.1270-sdk/lib/glut64.lib for GLUT_glut_LIBRARY
- Press configure twice, then generate

Open VS project c:/.../assimp--3.0.1270-sdk/build/Assimp.sln:
- Change to Release build.
- Right click on the Solution root in solution explorer and choose build
- Right click assimp in the solution explorer->properties
- Configuration Properties -> C/C++ -> Preprocessor
- Add (AS THE FIRST PREPROCESSOR DEFINITION) "_HAS_ITERATOR_DEBUGGING=0;_SECURE_SCL=0;" 
  to the front of the preprocessor list and do this for all
  configurations.
- Also do this for the projects assimp_cmd, assimple_simpleogl, etc.

/*  // THIS SECTION IS NO LONGER NEEDED
    Source code fixes:
    1.
    #include "pstdint.h" to the TOP of the include list for StringComparison.h
    2.
    vertex.h, LWOAnimation.cpp needs a #include <functional>.
    3.
    MeshRenderer.cpp needs to have #include <map> moved to the top of the include 
    list and it needs #include <functional> added.
    4.
    Comment out everything in pstdint.h and just leave:

    #ifdef _STDINT
    #undef _STDINT
    #endif
    #include <stdint.h>
    #include <stddef.h>
    #include <limits.h>
    #include <signal.h>
*/

At this point the assimp core libraries will all build, but if you want the 
samples then you'll need to change a few things:

- assimpe_simpleogl -> right click and open properties -> Open Linker ->
  General -> Additional Library Directories.  Add C:/.../assimp--3.0.1270-sdk/lib/
- Copy assimp--3.0.1270-sdkbuild/code/Release/assimp.dll to 
  C:\...\assimp--3.0.1270-sdk\build\samples\SimpleOpenGL\Release
- Run using assimp_simpleogl.exe directly (wont run through VS)

The all-important assimp.dll and .lib file are in 
assimp--3.0.1270-sdk/build/code/Release/.  The assimp header files are in]
assimp--3.0.1270-sdk/include/assimp.  Add all these to your project.
